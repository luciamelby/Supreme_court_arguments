The evidence is now clear that the American people in every region of the country have reached a consensus on that question.

well.Justice O'Connor, they vary remarkably little.I- it seems to me that the States would be free to define mental retardation and, as I say, many use the definition they already have, that their

obviously would inapprop- be an appropriate response so that the Virginia courts who did not, in this case, have before them mental retardation as a legal question that was going to decide anything it was simply an observation in the course of making...I I I think maybe the th- the Virginia Supreme Court's chara- i- b- decision on that can be best characterized as expressing concern as to whether or not the individual in this case Mr. Atkins had mental retardation because of the testimony of Dr.In in our view, Your Honor, the people with mental retardation who have both that intellectual functioning as the core and it has manifested itself in their life throughout their life those individuals in our view lack the culpability or blame worthiness because their understanding of their actions, their understanding of the context in which their actions took place...they are subject to criminal liability because it isn't our contention that they, for example, can't tell i- e- to use the the language in in in Virginia's defense of insanity, that they can't tell right from wrong.N- n- no- nothing in the ruling that we seek here would preclude the State from imposing the most serious penalty it has other than the penalty of death.Your Honor, I believe you're discus- discussing the Ford i- issue with regard to competence to be executed? I read the Ford case as suggesting that whether the individual had mental illness or mental retardation, if if that individual lacked the understanding as execution w- became imminent, that they w- that the State would be precluded from executing.Th- that test, it seems to me, is not adequate for several reasons.Yes.in any of these States,I- it s- seems to me, Your Honor, that it is not because because under our system of capital punishment, as it has been shaped by the decisions by this Court, we don't say that the death penalty is available for everyone who can be punished.and I think it's untrue.S- so, what we're saying in in in response to to to to your question, what we are saying is that a person who commits an act who has mental retardation, who commits an act which is subject to punishment, does so within the scope of the limitations imposed by his disability.The principal reason, and and it has changed a little bit as as the as the process has gone on.And and as I said, th- the principal focus is on the understanding of people of what the limitations imposed on people with mental retardation are and how it affects they th- their comprehension...It it it is it is that their understanding of the wrongness of their action may be incomplete and in a sense immature in the same way or in a parallel way at least...And and and that was the point I was adverting to w- was adverting to a moment ago, that the principal reason is, as I've suggested, the the shared understanding of the diminished culpability of people with mental retardation.C- counsel...He clearly can.That's right.There there may well be cases in which that would be effective in guarding against that concern, but that also backs into the problem this Court observed in Penry, which is in a case-by-case determination, particularly in cases in which juries are making the decision, the mental retardation may in fact be a two-edged sword, that the that the that the juror, in evaluating whether or not to impose the penalty of death, may see mental retardation not only as a mitigating or potentially mitigating factor, but it may also see it as tied to prospective dangerousness.I- is is is is the difficulty o- of case-by-case?
