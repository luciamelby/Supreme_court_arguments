    "# Supreme Court Oral Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to look at transcripts of the oral arguments in supreme court cases and examine if there was correlation between words/phrases and whether or not the court will vote in favor of the petitioner.  The text includes questions from the justices, and the oral arguments and answers from both the petitioner and the respondent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics are the words in the oral argument texts.  Stop words from NLTK are removed as well as common words and phases.  The next logical step would be to separate the questions and the oral arguments from each party into separate variables.  Also the number of questions asked by each justice and the justices hearing the case would be interesting metrics to examine.  The most time consuming part of the project was collecting the data and keeping the data for each case aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is split into 80/20 train/test split.  Both the train and test data is passed through the sklearn count vectorizer, using a n-gram range of 1-3, in order for the words not included in the test data to be variables in the evaluation of the test data. Baseline for the data is 0.651. The attempt at modeling the data was a standard logistic regression and multinomial naive bayes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model was evaluated using cross validation on the test data with 5 folds.  The mean of the cross validation score is 0.583.  The next step is a multinomial Naive Bayes model.  The accuracy score for the model is 0.614 and the 5 fold cross validated score is 0.667.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the first 2 models do not improve upon baseline, common phrases and words are added to the stop word list based on the most common n-grams.  The logistic regression and multinomial naive bales are run on the new words list.  The new mean cross validated 5 fold score for logistic regression is 0.634 and for naive bases is 0.646.  The results are not different enough from the first models to matter.  However, the 10 words with the highest coefficients for the logistic regression model for 1, 2, and 3 word combinations are in the next cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step was to look at decision tree classifiers and ensemble methods.  The results for these models are at the end of this notebook.  The ensemble methods are not any better than the logistic regression model."

       "   u' Ms. Stewart. '],\n",
       "  [u' Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court-- ',\n",
       "   u' We are here today not because a possibly innocent man was unjustly convicted nor are we here because he was possibly denied a constitutional right nor are we even here because he possibly was denied one of the rudimentary demands of a fair trial. ',\n",
       "   u' We are simply here today to resolve whether or not a guilty man should escape his just punishment as a result of a technical violation of a statute. ',\n",
       "   u' Specifically, the question presented here is whether or not Michael Bozeman is entitled to have his, was entitled to have his indictment dismissed with prejudice as a result of a one day transfer from Federal custody into State custody for purposes of arraignment and appointment of counsel. '],\n",
       "  [u\" Well, that's the clear provision of Article IV(e) of the Interstate Agreement, here, on Detainments. \",\n",
       "   u\" It couldn't be more clearly provided in there that the court shall enter an order dismissing with prejudice an indictment or complaint if he isn't tried immediately. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" Clearly the language, when it's read in isolation, seems to indicate that the indictment must be dismissed with prejudice-- \"],\n",
       "  [u\" Yeah, that's what it says. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" --but the language simply can't be read in isolation. \",\n",
       "   u' It has to be read against the background principle of harmless error, which was in existence at the time the IAD was passed. '],\n",
       "  [u' Well, I would think you maybe ought to just seek an amendment of the agreement. ',\n",
       "   u\" It's just clear. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" Well, there's a question whether or not the parties to the agreement can actually amend the agreement. \",\n",
       "   u' This is not a... this is an interstate compact involving 48 different states. '],\n",
       "  [u' Can Alabama just get out of it any time they want? ',\n",
       "   u' How does that work? '],\n",
       "  [u' They would have to go to their legislature and repeal participation. '],\n",
       "  [u' But the State could through this legislature just withdraw from the whole country? '],\n",
       "  [u' Yes, according to the act itself, it could withdraw from the whole Act itself, but to do so it would have to give up certain rights that are bestowed upon it in the Act that are very beneficial to the States in disposing of detainers. '],\n",
       "  [u\" Supposing there was an effort to amend this provision, if it proves that you're wrong about the... how could it be done? \",\n",
       "   u' Could Congress alone do it? '],\n",
       "  [u' Congress could not unilaterally change the provision of the compact. '],\n",
       "  [u\" Congress did it, didn't it, for Federal prisoners? \"],\n",
       "  [u' Congress did do it in Section 9 of the Agreement, but when Congress passed the original Agreement in Section 7, they reserved to themselves the right to amend the agreement. ',\n",
       "   u' Other States, specifically Alabama, do not have such a reservation clause in the Agreement, which would make it more difficult certainly to amend the Agreement. ',\n",
       "   u\" Now, there are some other States that have amended the Agreement unilaterally, but it's not been challenged whether or not that was permitted... permissible under the Agreement itself. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" Well, you shouldn't sign agreements that say this then if you don't intend to abide by it. \",\n",
       "   u\" It just couldn't be clearer. \",\n",
       "   u' It just says if trial is not had, the information or complaint shall not be of any further force and effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing. ',\n",
       "   u\" Why did your State sign that, adopt that if it wasn't prepared to abide by it. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" Well, the State adopted the Agreement partially... certainly because of the benefits to it, but it also adopted the Agreement against the background principle that harmless errors shouldn't apply. \"],\n",
       "  [u' I do not know a background principle that overcomes the explicit mandate of a statute, shall enter an order dismissing the same. ',\n",
       "   u\" Do you have cases that simply don't talk about where the implied effect of a provision in most cases is to cause dismissal of the suit, we won't let it happen when there's been no substantial prejudice, that I can understand, but here you have language that is categorically mandatory. \"],\n",
       "  [u' No, Your Honor, I do not have a case where this Court has specifically held harmless error applicable where there is a specific type of remedy such as this contained within the Agreement. '],\n",
       "  [u\" Isn't there a broader problem? \",\n",
       "   u\" And I have the same difficulty, I guess, with the Government's de minimis argument, and that is, it's true there is a... there is a, as you put it, a sort of background principle of the harmless error doctrine, and there's a background de minimis, but I don't think that there is a background to the effect that these either/or of these doctrines may be used to excuse an intentional and systematic series of violations of the statute, and it seems to me that that is what you are arguing for. \",\n",
       "   u\" You're saying not only would we move the person for two days for an arraignment here, we will continue to do it or we should be entitled to continue to do it, and even though that's a technical violation of the statute, we would in each case be excused on harmless error. \",\n",
       "   u' Do you know of any instance in which harmless error or de minimis, for that matter, has been used in effect to excuse a systematic violation of the statute? '],\n",
       "  [u' I do not know of a case where that has been done. ',\n",
       "   u\" However, I would say, number one, that an intentional violation act would certainly, whether or not it was intentional, would be a part of the harmless error analysis, and here I don't think there was an intentional act whatsoever. \",\n",
       "   u' I think the prosecutor simply misread the Act and dropped the ball, and as a result Mr.... if this Court holds that dismissal is required, then of course then the result, the purposes of this Act have not been maintained-- '],\n",
       "  [u' But I thought you were making a broader argument, and that is that this sort of transfer should be allowed. ',\n",
       "   u' It is... I mean, I can certainly see the value of making this transfer so that somebody who is not willing to waive arraignment can at least get counsel appointed and get the ball rolling toward prosecution, and I thought you were making the broader argument, not merely that this was a one time mistake, but that for the good reasons that support this procedure, we ought as a general matter to apply harmless error whenever it occurs. '],\n",
       "  [u\" --Mr. Justice Souter, I am making the broader argument that harmless error should apply to a statute unless there's an indication of an intent contrary to it that says that harmless error should not apply, and it's my position that this statute does not indicate such an intent that harmless error should not apply. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" How do we know it's harmless? \"],\n",
       "  [u' Excuse me? '],\n",

       "   u\" There's a person in another State, you want to try him. \",\n",
       "   u\" Now, you're not supposed to bring him out of that State until you're ready to go to trial? \",\n",
       "   u' How does it normally work? '],\n",
       "  [u' Normally Article IV works that you bring the prisoner over and you have 120 days within which to try him. '],\n",
       "  [u\" So you're going to put him in the county jail? \"],\n",
       "  [u' Right. '],\n",
       "  [u' But you have the indictment before you get him, is that right? '],\n",

       "  [u\" So what's he coming for, just the trial? \"],\n",
       "  [u\" Under the Act, that is the purposes, he's supposed to... if you read the language in its technical, in its... on its face, then, yes, that seems to be the only purpose which you can bring him to. \"],\n",
       "  [u' The only reason that a State... Joe Smith is in California. ',\n",
       "   u\" Now, you're going to use this Act, you're bringing him, you're under this Act in Article VI, you don't even want to see him until you're ready to go to trial, is that the theory of it? \"],\n",
       "  [u' That seems to be the theory, if you read it, on its face. '],\n",
       "  [u' But now might you sometimes-- '],\n",
       "  [u' But certainly, no-- '],\n",
       "  [u' --have to see him in Alabama before you go to trial? '],\n",

       "   u\" Don't you sometimes have to see a defendant before he goes to trial? \"],\n",
       "  [u' Absolutely. ',\n",
       "   u' And that is why this individual was brought to Alabama, to have the appointment of counsel. '],\n",
       "  [u\" So this must come up all the time, I mean, you bring a person into the State, we say it's not, we're not ready for trial yet, but we're going to the arraignment or we're going to have a hearing on suppression or a lot of things. \"],\n",

       "   u' Article IX of the Act specifically says that it should be construed in such a way as to effectuate those purposes, and to construe this Act as requiring dismissal of the indictment is not going to effectuate those purposes. '],\n",

       "  [u' --We could give the person the choice, but certainly again that could just simply lead to more litigation, and whether or not he understood what he was waiving and what right he had, and also we have to get him here practically in Alabama, the practical way, you have to get the person into Alabama before you can appoint counsel.

Hill and decided whether or not waiver applied to the Act, and similarly the argument made there was that because the Act said that it shall be, that if there's a violation of the 120-day provision that the Act shall be... or the indictment shall be dismissed with prejudice, that waiver shouldn't apply because and that the Act specifically should say whether it should or shouldn't. \"],\n",

       "  [u\" I think there is a significance in that that case involved waiver, but it's not for the purposes of the argument that I'm making which is that the IAD was silent on whether or not waiver principles applied to it, just as it's silent as to whether or not harmless error principles apply to it. \",\n",
       "   u\" This Court held that because it was silent and because the general principle, there's a presumption that waiver applies that waiver should apply there. \",\n",

       "  [u\" It seems it would apply then in every case, and here was a prosecutor who made a perfectly reasonable choice were it not for this IAD to say, we're going to turn him around in 24 hours, just want to arraign him and send him back, but the literal reading of this cuts the other way, and if you don't hold prosecutors to that literal reading, then every case would be harmless, and must, shall would have no teeth at all. \"],\n",

       "   u' And it seems to me that every case like that would be harmless error and not... and then you have the words of the statute and then simply not enforced. '],\n",
       "  [u\" --I do think that there is a situation where you could bring somebody just for one day and there could be harm to them, if they weren't involved specifically, say, it was the time to take a GED, for instance, was that day, and they couldn't take it as a result, and it wouldn't be given for, you know, another year or something along that lines, it would be harm to the defendant, so there could be harm from a single day transfer. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" Well, on that, even in this case illustrates the particular day, first it was one day, then another day, so it doesn't seem that the particular day is what's at issue. \",\n",

       "   u\" As the majority of Federal courts have held, a brief interruption in a prisoner's confinement does not require dismissal of the State indictment against the prisoner under Article IV(e) of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. \",\n",

       "  [u' --Pardon? '],\n",
       "  [u' Why would a long interruption be worse? '],\n",
       "  [u' There are two reasons, Your Honor. ',\n",
       "   u' First, a long interruption would often cause the prisoner to lose his place in programs and then he would also, may lose his priority-- '],\n",
       "  [u\" That's the... the interruption part wouldn't. \",\n",

       "  [u\" --That's correct, Your Honor. \",\n",
       "   u\" Our view is that the interruption is what is de minimis in this case, and when the interruption is merely for an overnight period, it does not cause a disruption in the inmate's participation in programs of rehabilitation in the original institution of confinement. \",\n",
       "   u' If there was a long period of interruption, in contrast, the inmate would have to start over in the programs or could possibly lose his place as priority of the programs, depending on the institution, so we believe that, yes, in fact, there could be a longer interruption that would cause harm to the-- '],\n",
       "  [u\" But if your rationale is to protect the interests of the prisoner, why isn't the waiver the solution? \"],\n",
       "  [u' --In an ideal world, yes, they would get waivers, but in our experience this situation arises because of miscommunications. ',\n",
       "   u\" For example, in a case called United States v. Taylor, the United States Marshal Service placed a detainer on the prisoner, and the United States attorney's office was not aware of that detainer. \",\n",
       "   u' Consequently, when they obtained custody of the prisoner, they said... the magistrate specifically asked, is there a detainer on this prisoner? ',\n",

       "   u' They sent the prisoner back, not realizing that-- '],\n",
       "  [u\" But we can't make the law take care of miscommunication within the United States Department of Justice, can we? \",\n",
       "   u\" We've got to assume everybody knows what's going on? \"],\n",
       "  [u\" --Of course, Your Honor, but the rule of de minimis that when the event is so insubstantial in relationship to the purposes of the statute, the law does not take cognizance of it, and a single overnight transfer, like the one at issue here, is insubstantial in relationship to the purposes of the prohibition, and that purpose is to ensure rehabilitation of the prisoner and the prisoner's participation in the rehabilitation program. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" Yeah, but to the extent you rely on the interests of the prisoner, it seems to me that interest is totally protected by a simple requirement that he can waive because he would presumably have counsel to advise him, listen, you're better off if you go back and continue your program. \",\n",
       "   u\" I just don't understand why the waiver isn't a complete answer. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" Your Honor, it's not a complete answer for two reasons. \",\n",
       "   u\" First, one, oftentimes prisoners would prefer that there is a mistake and that they actually got sent back and the indictment be dismissed, and second, there is an interest in the institution, the sending institution in receiving the prisoner back because it's the State's interest to ensure that its prisoners are undergoing the rehabilitation programs that they are providing, and when the prisoner is away for an undue period of time, such as the sometimes lengthy period between arraignment and trial, they are not participating in those numerous programs, and it is to the State's detriment, and so in that sense, although we often rely on the prisoner as in the context of waiver to-- \"],\n",
       "  [u' Was this the essential rationale for the Act, that the prisoner have these correctional programs or was it more the thought that a State should be entitled to impose its punishment for retribution purposes? '],\n",
       "  [u' --The Act has twin purposes, and the two purposes are, one, to set up a system of an expeditious system whereby States could obtain prisoners from other jurisdictions and exact their punishment or impose the penalties prescribed by law, and the other purpose was to ensure that while they were doing that it did not unduly interfere with the State that had the prisoner in its confinement and its programs of rehabilitation, so it should have been-- '],\n",
       "  [u' Would the Act have been complied with here if the prisoner, instead of being returned to Florida, the Florida prison, had gone to some other prison because it says he has to be returned to the original place of imprisonment? '],\n",
       "  [u' --Your Honor, if one were to read the language quite literally, they could have sent him to a Federal institution, for example, in some other part of Alabama, and it would not have invoked the literal language of the statute, and dismissal would not have been required. '],\n",
       "  [u' Have there been any cases on that? '],\n",
       "  [u' No, it is a rather poorly drafted agreement in that respect, but because it is an agreement, because it is-- '],\n",

       "  [u\" If that's not where he originally came from. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" --That's not where he originally came from, and that situation occurs, for example, where the United States marshals retain custody of a high security prisoner, as they have the right to do, when they have concerns that the State may not have appropriate facilities, that they would retain that prisoner potentially in another location other than that one of original confinement. \",\n",
       "   u\" It is not a well drafted agreement, but it is at its core a contract, an agreement among the States, and for that reason the sometimes more flexible terms of construction applicable to contracts, such as breach and performance, are applicable here, given the harsh consequences of a violation, complete frustration of the State's efforts to enforce its criminal law, we believe that the rule of de minimis is of particular force in this context. \",\n",

       "  [u' --Indeed, when Congress enacted that special provision, the courts were divided 4-2 in favor of that, the rule of de minimis or something similar to it. ',\n",
       "   u' Four different circuits had held that in a single overnight transfer or a very short term transfer that did not interfere with the purposes of the Act, did not require dismissal with prejudice, there were two courts of appeals that were to the contrary, and Congress therefore stepped in with a different rule and amended the Act as it was entitled to do under Article... under Section 7 of the implementing legislation.

       "  [u\" But States couldn't replicate that because they all have to be bound by the same, is that so or don't you know what is the answer to that? \"],\n",
       "  [u\" The Fourth Circuit has addressed that issue in a case called Bush v. Muncie, and it's not a matter of any clarity, but it appears that it would be somewhat difficult for a State to unilaterally amend its implementing legislation without withdrawing unless it, as Congress did in Section 7, had expressly reserved that right, and then if it had, if it did enact the provision that was inconsistent with the Agreement, there would be an issue among the States as to whether or not those States were willing to give that amending State the benefits of the Agreement, notwithstanding its departure in some degree. \"],\n",
       "  [u\" Wouldn't the easy way to do it, though, simply be to... for the States that wanted to at least to enter into a new pact sort of in the nature of a codicil, and put that before Congress in the contract clause... the compact clause, and at least as among those States that agreed to the amendment, I would suppose there would be no impediment to applying the same rule that the United States has. \",\n",
       "   u\" I mean, that wouldn't be all that tough. \"],\n",
       "  [u' Oh, for 48 states to arrive at the Agreement, to pass it as implementing legislation in each of those 48 states and to get Congress to pass on the compact is a somewhat arduous, although it is potentially viable prospect. ',\n",
       "   u\" However, we believe that just as Congress resolved, in effect, a 4-2 circuit conflict in favor of the rule of de minimis and in favor of permitting these returns, we believe that this Court could take cognizance of the rule of de minimis as well and rule that because a single overnight transfer is so unlikely to interfere with the purposes of the Act that it falls within the rule of de minimis and therefore should not result in harsh consequence of complete frustration of the State's efforts to enforce its criminal laws. \",\n",

       "   u\" How is it really supposed to work because intuitively I'd think that a person who comes from a preliminary hearing, the longer he stays away, the worse things are, but this provision seems to force the State to keep him away. \"],\n",
       "  [u' --Well, no more than 120 days, Justice Breyer, and again I mentioned the short time periods that are involved here. ',\n",

       "   u\" However, the Federal Government provision would allow that by reading the Federal amendment, the Article IX, which says if there's a hearing and the court orders that you're sent back, that's not a violation, but that's only applying to the Federal Government as a receiving State. \",\n",
       "   u\" It's not in the main body of the IAD, and I think that that is significant in terms of the statutory construction. \",\n",

       "  [u' Well, I did have the same question as the Chief Justice. ',\n",
       "   u' It seemed to me that earlier the prisoner sees his new State counsel and begins working on the case and then the more time before the case starts, the better off the prisoner is. '],\n",
       "  [u' The more time to confer with his counsel or? ',\n",

       "   u' He did not appeal. ',\n",
       "   u' He made no objection to the transfer. ',\n",
       "   u' He was transferred pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum rather than as a detainer. ',\n",
       "   u' This was before this Court had dealt with Mauro. ',\n",
       "   u' Then when he had a probation violation, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus asking that the IAD be recognized. ',\n",
       "   u' In Reed v. Farley, this Court has held that habeas corpus is not something that can be used to recognize violations of the IAD, so that would simply not apply. ',\n",
       "   u' This case is then cited as justification in another Second Circuit case, the Roy case, Mr. Roy had so many detainers from so many different jurisdictions that I feel quite certain that the Second Circuit was looking for any reason whatsoever to keep from excusing him. ',\n",
       "   u' Mr. Roy had another case in the Seventh Circuit which referred to the Second Circuit case and to the Chico case, and in fact the same transfer was complained about in the Second Circuit and in the Seventh and the Second Circuit cases. ',\n",
       "   u\" The Taylor case that Mr. Lamken mentioned does say that a brief transfer doesn't happen, but the prisoner there asked to be transferred back to State custody. \",\n",
       "   u\" There's quite clearly a waiver, although the Court for some inexplicable reason doesn't seem to reach that. \",\n",
       "   u\" That's a First Circuit case. \",\n",
       "   u' The Fifth Circuit Sassoon case is also was raised on habeas corpus, and in fact it was raised on habeas corpus in the State courts. ',\n",
       "   u' Mr. Sassoon had not appealed the issue following his conviction. ',\n",
       "   u\" Sixth Circuit Taylor case, many of these people for some unknown reason seem to be named Taylor, the court there held that since he was held in a jail and hadn't been transferred to a prison yet, that there was no violation, and then adds, and besides, all these other courts hold that quick, temporary transfers do not violate the IAD. \",\n",
       "   u\" It mentions Article IX of the Federal amendment in a footnote but doesn't rely on it. \",\n",
       "   u\" I find it somewhat inexplicable that these courts have this Federal amendment available to them, but it's evidently not being used because none of the opinions that I've found have done more than mention it in a footnote. \"],\n",
       "  [u' Well, were these Federal prisoners? '],\n",
       "  [u' Yes, sir. '],\n",
       "  [u' So they could get, the State could get, the Government could get the advantage of the Federal amendment? '],\n",
       "  [u' Yes, all these are cases where the United States was the receiving State. ',\n",
       "   u\" The Eighth Circuit Baxter case mentions this but it's again citing Chico, Taylor, and Roy, but it really resolves the issue on the fact that Mr. Baxter was transferred by writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum before a detainer had been lodged, so it really doesn't add to the argument other than to saying, yes, us, too, and the Ninth Circuit Johnson case simply comes down saying well, we've looked through and this is what the majority thinks, and we think that also. \",\n",
       "   u\" I would also point out that another reason I believe this cannot be de minimis or harmless error is that we tend to focus in on the phrase, the Court shall enter an order dismissing with prejudice, but there's also a self executing clause in there, it seems that by the transfer itself, ex operi operato, the indictment becomes without further effect. \",\n",
       "   u\" Now, that is something that I believe that it requires an objection prior to trial to preserve that, just like any sort of defect in an indictment would require, yet it's not something that you can apply harmless error or de minimis analysis to. \",\n",
       "   u\" If the... it seems somewhat redundant to have, then having the court enter a ruling dismissing the charge but I believe that that's to prevent the prosecutor from coming back and reindicting on these same charges, and it also recognizes that there really is no indictment, self executing clauses being somewhat difficult to enforce otherwise. \",\n",
       "   u\" I would also point out, it's not very difficult for the States to follow these rules. \",\n",
       "   u\" It's laid out quite clearly. \",\n",
       "   u' In this particular case, as I have set out in the red brief, the prosecutor had ample opportunity to know what the statute said and to follow the rules. ',\n",
       "   u' She even had notice from Mr. Bozeman himself who had filed a pro se motion objecting to a prior transfer that said the IAD requires dismissal. ',\n",
       "   u\" It's... to excuse that is simply, I believe, would be saying that a prosecutor can do whatever he or she pleases and that they hope to be able to get away with it by claiming that it's harmless. \",\n",
       "   u' As a practical matter, a trial court judge is almost always going to rule that an error is harmless. ',\n",

       "   u' And also, this statute provides a bright line. ',\n",
       "   u' I think that there are going to be endless hearings on whether or not harm has taken place if this Court rules that harmless error can apply. ',\n",

',\n",
       "   u\" Also, it's very important to point out that the agreement was not just for the benefit of the prisoner here, this agreement was entered into for the benefit of the party States as well as for the benefit of the prisoner, and that purpose is specifically stated in Article I, and it is one of the purposes that needs to be considered in determining whether or not a harmless error analysis should apply. \",\n",
       "   u\" In response to Justice Stevens' question about waiver and whether or not we could just have the prisoner waive, I think it's important to point out that the respondent has argued that one of the problems with implementing harmless error is it would lead to additional litigation in the trial courts, and I would point out that if we have a hearing every time we need to determine whether or not the prisoner wants to waive the right, then again we're going to have additional litigation, so either way we're going to come up with additional litigation. \",\n",
       "   u\" In answer to Justice Breyer's question about what's the purpose behind Article IV(e), I think it's simply meant to implement Article IV(c), and it's a way to bring the prisoner over, and we need to have him here, dispose of the charges, and bring him back, but I don't think the purpose is to give the prisoner some sort of benefit, some sort of way to have the charges disposed of short of a trial. \",\n",
       "   u' Finally, Mr. Bozeman made no argument below about harm and that he suffered any harm, so it should not be considered here, and if this Court has no further questions, I thank you. '],\n",
